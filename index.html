title: "About me"
---

<p>
    Iâ€™m a machine learning researcher with a Ph.D. in Machine Learning applied to Computational Biology from the
    University of Navarra.
    Throughout my doctoral journey, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of <strong>graph
        learning</strong>â€”working with knowledge graphs and graph neural networksâ€”and explore a range of
    <strong>representation learning</strong> methods, including variational autoencoders and causal frameworks.
    A big part of my research focused on integrating and analyzing <strong>multi-omics data</strong>, from bulk RNA-seq
    and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to spatial transcriptomics and Perturb-seq. <br>
</p>

<p>
    These efforts resulted in numerous publications in top machine learning conferences and journals, such as
    <strong>ICLR 2025</strong> and <strong>Nature Machine Intelligence</strong>. I was also selected as a
    <strong>Fulbright Excellence Fellow</strong> ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, which allowed me to carry out part of my research at the Center
    for Data Science at New York Universityâ€”an incredibly formative and inspiring experience.
</p>

<p>
    These days, my work is centered on the intersection of machine learning and quantitative finance.
    Iâ€™m focused on the <strong>design and development of predictive models for MFT (medium-frequency trading)
        strategies</strong> in the cryptocurrency derivatives market.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of work, I love taking on Kaggle challenges and am proud to be a <strong>Kaggle Competitions
        Expert</strong>. Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems and enjoy collaborating across
    disciplinesâ€”whether itâ€™s in biology, healthcare, or finance.
