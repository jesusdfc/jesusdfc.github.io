title: "About me"
---

<p>
    I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning applied to Computational Biology from the University of Navarra.
    My doctoral research focused on <strong>graph learning</strong>—particularly knowledge graphs and graph neural
    networks—as well as a broad spectrum of <strong>representation learning</strong> techniques, ranging from
    variational autoencoders to causal representation frameworks.
    I specialized in leveraging <strong>multi-omics datasets</strong>, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq
    (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and Perturb-seq.
    As part of my Ph.D., I completed a research stay at the Center for Data Science at New York University as a
    <strong>Fulbright Excellence Fellow</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, I am focused on the <strong>design and implementation of machine learning models for MFT
        (medium-frequency trading) strategies</strong> on cryptocurrency derivatives.
    My work integrates real-time prediction, strategy optimization, and the deployment of high-performance learning
    systems for market modeling.
</p>

<p>
    I have published in top machine learning conferences and journals, including <strong>ICLR 2025</strong> and
    <strong>Nature Machine Intelligence</strong>.
    My full publication record is available on my
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uXbuO-sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> profile.
</p>

<p>
    I’m also an active participant in the machine learning community and a proud <strong>Kaggle Competitions
        Expert</strong>.
    I enjoy working on competitive data science problems, and I’m passionate about applying AI to interdisciplinary
    challenges in biology, healthcare, and finance.
