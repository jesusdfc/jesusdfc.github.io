<p>
    I’m a machine learning researcher with a Ph.D. in Machine Learning applied to Computational Biology from the
    University of Navarra.
    During my doctoral journey, I explored the fascinating world of <strong>graph learning</strong>—including knowledge
    graphs and graph neural networks—as well as a variety of <strong>representation learning</strong> approaches such as
    variational autoencoders and causal representation frameworks.
    A big part of my work involved integrating and analyzing <strong>multi-omics data</strong> like bulk RNA-seq,
    single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and Perturb-seq.

    🏅 I’m really proud to have published in top-tier machine learning venues such as <strong>ICLR 2025</strong> and
    <strong>Nature Machine Intelligence</strong>, and to have been selected as a <strong>Fulbright Excellence
        Fellow</strong> 🇺🇸 for a research stay at the Center for Data Science at New York University.

    These days, my focus has shifted toward financial machine learning. I’m working on the <strong>design and
        implementation of ML models for MFT (medium-frequency trading) strategies</strong> in the world of
    cryptocurrency derivatives—blending real-time prediction, smart strategy design, and performance-driven modeling.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of work, I love taking on Kaggle challenges and am proud to be a <strong>Kaggle Competitions Expert</strong>
    . I’m passionate about solving complex problems and enjoy collaborating across disciplines—whether it’s in
    biology, healthcare, or finance.
