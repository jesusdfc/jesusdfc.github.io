---

<p>
    I hold a <strong>Ph.D. in Machine Learning</strong> applied to Computational Biology (University of Navarra),
    where I specialized in graph neural networks, representation learning, and causal inference.
    My work spanned multi-omics data integration (RNA-seq, single-cell, spatial transcriptomics) and led to publications
    in
    <strong>ICLR</strong> and <strong>Nature Machine Intelligence</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    As a <strong>Fulbright Excellence Fellow</strong> 🇺🇸 at NYU’s Center for Data Science,
    I deepened my expertise in scalable ML systems and interdisciplinary research.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, I focus on the design and development of predictive models for
    <strong>medium-frequency trading (MFT) strategies</strong> in the cryptocurrency derivatives market —
    combining statistical learning, time-series modeling, and signal extraction for trading automation.

<p>
    I’m also a Kaggle Competitions Expert, passionate about solving complex applied ML problems
    and bridging research and real-world applications across finance, healthcare, and biotech.
